# Tech Salaries Analysis and Prediction ðŸ“Š

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 

This project is all about analyzing and predicting tech industry salaries using Python. It includes a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning techniques to gain insights from a dataset of tech salaries and create predictive models for base salary estimations.  

## Project Highlights  

1. **Data Analysis:** Insights into compensation distribution by race, education, and experience, along with the top companies represented in the dataset.  
2. **Visualizations:** Bar charts for education levels and company representation, histograms and pie charts for salary and income distribution, and heatmaps to understand feature correlations.  
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Built and evaluated models using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressors, exploring feature importance and model optimization using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  

## Features  

- **Dataset:** Pulled from a GitHub repository (`tech_companies_salary.csv`) and includes columns for race, education, company, and total yearly compensation.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels.  
  - Machine Learning: Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Managed missing values in education and race columns and encoded categorical data using Label Encoding.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Distribution of salaries across races and education levels, along with visualizations of company representation and compensation trends.  

## Visualizations  

- **Racial Distribution:** Visualizes the number of employees and income distribution across different races.  
- **Education vs. Base Salary:** Displays the total base salaries held by various education levels.  
- **Company Representation:** Highlights the top 20 companies in the dataset.  

## Lessons Learned  

Through this project, I learned:  
- Cleaning and encoding data for machine learning models.  
- Using various regression models and evaluating their performance.  
- Visualizing complex datasets to uncover insights.  
- Handling missing data effectively in real-world datasets.  

## Future Improvements  

- Include additional features for better model predictions.  
- Experiment with more advanced machine learning algorithms.  
- Add interactivity to the visualizations using Plotly or Dash.
